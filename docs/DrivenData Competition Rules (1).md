# DrivenData Competition Rules

---

# GUIDELINES

These guidelines are intended to summarize a few main features of the competition rules. Full details are provided in the competition rules below.

## One account per participant

You cannot sign up to DrivenData from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.

## Private sharing of code

Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.

## Submission limits

The number of submissions allowed is restricted to a fixed value or rate on a per-competition basis. Any attempt to circumvent this limit will result in disqualification.

## Documentation for winning solutions

Winning solutions must be documented using the version of the [Winning Model Documentation Template](https://github.com/drivendataorg/prize-winner-template/blob/main/example_documentation_guide.pdf) that will be provided to top-ranking participants to be eligible for recognition and prize money if offered.

## Winner License Type: Open source license

Winning solutions need to be made available under The MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) in order to be eligible for recognition and prize money if offered. Unless otherwise specified on the challenge website, any software or pre-trained models required to generate the solution must also be available under an open source or open-weight license that does not prohibit free commercial use, so that solutions could be reproduced using only publicly available software and models.

## External Data Rule: External data with rights

External data is permitted in this Competition provided Participants have all rights, licenses and permissions to use the external data as contemplated in the Competition Rules, and that such data complies with any external data restrictions stated on the Competition Website. Any use of external data must be pursuant to and in accordance with a valid license that permits use of the external data in this Competition without the need for additional approvals from any third party.

## Use of test data

Unless otherwise specified on the website, each test data sample should be processed independently during inference without the use of information from other cases in the test set. By default, this precludes using information gathered across multiple test samples as feature inputs or target labels for model training, for instance through pseudo labeling or unsupervised learning on the test set. As a result, running model training code with the same training data but a different set of test data or no test data should produce the same model weights and fitted feature parameters. Eligible solutions must be able to run inference on new test data automatically, without retraining the model.

## Questions?

The challenge rules are in place to promote fair competition and useful solutions. If you are ever unsure whether your solution meets the competition rules, ask the challenge organizers in the competition forum or send an email to info@drivendata.org.

## Selection of winners

This Competition is a challenge of skill and the final results are determined by evaluating a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors, as more fully described on the Competition Website. For that portion of the Competition evaluated quantitatively, the results will be determined solely by leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard based on an objective statistical evaluation metric published on the Competition Website prior to commencement of the Competition (subject to compliance with these Competition Rules). Participants' scores and ranks on the Competition Website at any given stage of the Competition will be based on the objective statistical evaluation metric described on the Competition Website, as determined by applying the predictions in the Submission to the ground truth of a validation dataset whose instances were a fixed set sampled from the Data. Scores displayed on the public leaderboard while the competition is running may or may not be the same as the final scores on the private leaderboard, depending on how samples from the Data are used for evaluation. For that portion of the Competition evaluated qualitatively, the results will be determined by a panel of judges, as more fully described on the Competition Website. As more fully described on the Competition Website, the Competition may have quantitative winners, qualitative winners, combined quantitative and qualitative winners, or all three.

The evaluation metric or judging rubric used for scoring and ranking Submissions will be displayed on the Competition Website.

The anticipated number of and amount of prize awards that will be awarded for this Competition are set forth on the Competition Website; however, DrivenData is not obligated to make all or any awards and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to award fewer than the anticipated number of awards if an insufficient number of entries are deemed worthy in accordance with the evaluation criteria and challenge requirements.

Any prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Competition Rules. All decisions of DrivenData, the Competition Sponsor and/or judges will be final and binding on all matters relating to this Competition. DrivenData reserves the right to examine the Submission and any associated code or documentation for compliance with these Competition Rules. In the event that the Submission demonstrates a breach of these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor or DrivenData may at its discretion take either of the following actions:

* disqualify your Submission(s); or  
* require that you remediate within one week any issues identified in your Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts and confirmation of the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses). DrivenData is under no obligation to alert you of any issues with your Submission or permit you to remediate any identified issues.

A tie between two or more valid and identically ranked submissions will be resolved in favor of the tied submission that was submitted first.

A Participant may decline to be nominated as a Winner by notifying DrivenData directly within one week following the Competition deadline, in which case the declining Participant forgoes any prize or other features associated with winning the Competition. DrivenData reserves the right to disqualify a Participant who so declines at DrivenData's sole discretion if DrivenData deems disqualification appropriate.

## Prizes and conditions

If the Competition has a prize, the Prize Winner(s) will be notified by email. The Prize Winner(s) will receive their prizes awarded as a check or electronic transfer from DrivenData.

If a Team wins a prize, all Team members must submit a single written statement describing how the prize is to be allocated among the Team members. If the Team fails to submit such statement within 10 days after DrivenData requests it, then DrivenData will distribute the prize among Team members in equal shares and will have no further obligation to winning Team members.

As a condition of receipt of a prize, winner must deliver their solution’s code and documentation to DrivenData. The source code must contain a description of resources required to build and run the solution, and should be able to sufficiently reproduce winning results and generate predictions on new data samples with and without retraining. The accompanying documentation should be consistent with DrivenData’s [Winning Model Documentation Template](https://github.com/drivendataorg/prize-winner-template/blob/main/example_documentation_guide.pdf), a version of which will be provided to winners after the competition. Winner must complete the specific version of the documentation template provided for the competition. Winner must also sign and return any documents provided in connection with prize acceptance as may be required by DrivenData or Competition Sponsor, including without limitation eligibility certifications and U.S. tax forms.

The prize may be awarded to an alternate winner if required documentation is not returned within fifteen (15) days after mailing to winner, if prize notification letter/email or prize is returned as undeliverable, if winner does not respond to an email or other communication from DrivenData within seven (7) days of the date sent, or if the winner, in DrivenData’s judgment, does not respond to reasonable requests for information related to prize delivery or is otherwise unable or unwilling to coordinate prize delivery within fifteen (15) days after prize notification. Allow thirty (30) days for prize delivery. By accepting any prize/award, Winner agrees to allow DrivenData and/or the Competition Sponsor to disclose Winner’s first name, first initial of last name, and city of residence, as well as prize information to the extent required by law, and if so required by law, Winner agrees to the disclosure of additional personal information, all without additional compensation.

DrivenData is responsible only for prize delivery and is not responsible for prize utility or otherwise. No substitution or transfer of prizes is permitted. All taxes, fees and expenses associated with participation in the Competition or receipt and use of a prize are the sole responsibility of the Prize Winner(s).

CHEATING. Participating using more than one DrivenData account is deemed cheating and, if discovered, will result in disqualification from the Competition and any other affected Competitions and may result in banning or deactivation of affected DrivenData accounts.

DrivenData reserves the right to request information associated with our investigation of suspected cheating. Failure to respond to these requests (including failure to furnish the requested information) within ten (10) days is grounds for disqualification.

RECEIVING PRIZES. After verification of eligibility, if prizes are awarded, each Prize winner will receive the prize in the form of a check or electronic transfer from DrivenData made out to the Prize winner (if an individual, or to the individual Team members if a Team). Allow 30 days from final verification and confirmation for Prize delivery. Winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS 1099 form from DrivenData in the amount of their prize at the appropriate time. Prize winners are responsible for any taxes, fees or other liability resulting from their receipt of a Prize.

## Permissions

Except where prohibited by law, entry constitutes permission to use winners’ names, hometowns, images, statements and likenesses for online posting, and/or any advertising and publicity without additional compensation. Winners may also be required to sign and return a release of liability, declaration of eligibility and, where lawful, a publicity consent agreement, as conditions of receiving a prize. Failure to comply with the aforementioned conditions shall be grounds for forfeiture of a prize.

PARTICIPANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING/ASSIGNMENT. All Participants grant DrivenData, the Competition Sponsor and/or judges a limited, worldwide license to use each Participant’s Submission for the administration of the Competition.

As a further condition of receipt of a Prize, each winning Participant thereby licenses their winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission according to the Winner License/Assignment Type specified above (note: if no Winner License/Assignment Type is specified above, the Winner License/Assignment Type is deemed to be Non-Exclusive License).

## Data use and code sharing

DATA. "Data" means the data or datasets linked from the Competition Website for the purpose of use by Participants in the Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, Data is deemed for the purpose of these Competition Rules to include any prototype or executable code provided to Participants by DrivenData or via the Competition Website. Participants must use the Data only as permitted by these Competition Rules and any associated data use rules specified on the Competition Website.

Unless otherwise permitted by the terms of the Competition Website, Participants must use the Data solely for the purpose and duration of the Competition, including but not limited to reading and learning from the Data, analyzing the Data, modifying the Data and generally preparing your Submission and any underlying models and participating in forum discussions on the Competition Website.

Participants agree to keep the Data secure, including encrypting any Data stored on a laptop, portable device, or removable storage medium (for example, by enabling full-disk encryption such as FileVault on macOS or BitLocker on Windows).

Participants explicitly agree to make no attempt to utilize the Data to identify specific individuals, and will immediately delete relevant Data and notify DrivenData in the event of inadvertent discovery of the identity of any person represented in the Data during the Competition. Participants agree to use suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Competition Rules from gaining access to the Data and agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Data to any party not participating in the Competition. Participants agree to notify DrivenData immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission or unauthorized access of the Data and agree to work with DrivenData to rectify any unauthorized transmission. Participants agree that participation in the Competition shall not be construed as having or being granted a license (expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) under, or any right of ownership in, any of the Data.

Any recordings data in repositories linked to from the Competition site but not hosted by DrivenData is not controlled, hosted, or licensed by DrivenData, and DrivenData makes no representations or warranties regarding such third-party data or applicable third-party terms.

All Data copies must be destroyed or returned by Participants after the Competition, absent separate executed licenses to the data. Any commercial or derivate use of the data outside the challenge is prohibited except with valid license after the Competition. For further information on licenses outside of the Competition, participants may contact Data providers using contact information and links provided in due course on the Competition Website.

Participants agree to include appropriate attribution to the Competition and Data providers in any publication, presentation, or public description of work developed using the Data.

EXTERNAL DATA. Participants’ use of external data is subject to the External Data Rule specified in the Competition Guidelines and any rules on external data expressly stated on the Competition Website (note: if no External Data Rule is specified above, the External Data Rule is deemed to be No External Data).

* NO EXTERNAL DATA. Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Competition Website, Participants must not use data other than the Data to develop and test their models and Submissions.  
* OPEN EXTERNAL DATA. Participants may use external data other than the Data, including pre-trained models, to develop and test their solutions, provided that they comply with any external data restrictions stated on the Competition Website and the external data is freely and publicly available to all Participants under a permissive [open license](https://opendefinition.org/) that does not prohibit commercial use (e.g., CC0 or CC-BY).  
* EXTERNAL DATA WITH RIGHTS. Participants may use external data other than the Data, including pre-trained models, to develop and test their solutions, provided that the Participant has all rights, licenses and permissions to use the external data as contemplated in these Competition Rules. Participant represents and warrants that any use of any external data in connection with participation in this Competition is pursuant to and in accordance with a valid license that permit use of the external data in this Competition without the need for additional approvals from any third party, and agrees to provide DrivenData with proof (to DrivenData’s satisfaction) of such license upon request at any time during the Competition or evaluation process. Failure to satisfy any of these requirements in accordance with DrivenData’s instructions and timing, or DrivenData’s reasonable belief, as determined in DrivenData’s sole discretion, that a Participant does not have all necessary consents and licenses (notwithstanding any certification by Participant) will result in disqualification from the Competition and forfeiture of any prize claim.

Furthermore, unless otherwise expressly stated on the Competition Website:

* Participants may annotate provided training data as long as they are included with solutions to enable reproduction and do not overfit to the test set;  
* Participants may not add any manual annotations to the provided test data. Eligible solutions need to be able to run on test samples automatically using the test data as provided.

Competition Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any Participant who Competition Sponsor discovers has undertaken or attempted to undertake the use of data other than the Data, or who uses the Data other than as permitted according to the Competition Website and in these Competition Rules, in the course of the Competition.

CODE SHARING. Participants are prohibited from privately sharing source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, and any such sharing is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification. Participants are permitted to publicly share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Data, or otherwise relevant to the Competition, provided that such sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. By so sharing, the sharing Participant is thereby deemed to have licensed the shared code under the MIT License (an open source software license commonly described at [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
